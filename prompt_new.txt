Thank you for providing the necessary information. Based on your input, I can suggest some options for dinner that align with your preferences.

Since you have indicated a preference for seafood and it is Thursday, I assume you are looking for dinner ideas that are quick and easy to prepare. Here are some suggestions:

1. Grilled Salmon with Roasted Vegetables: Salmon is a great source of protein and pairs well with roasted vegetables like asparagus or Brussels sprouts. You can season the salmon fillets with lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper, and grill them in the oven until cooked through.
2. Shrimp Scampi Pasta: This classic Italian dish is easy to make and features shrimp saut√©ed in garlic butter and served over pasta. You can find pre-cooked shrimp at most supermarkets, making this option quick and convenient.
3. Crab Cakes with Mixed Greens Salad: Crab cakes are a delicious way to enjoy seafood without breaking the bank. You can mix together crab meat, breadcrumbs, egg, and seasonings, shape into patties, and pan-fry until golden brown. Serve with a mixed greens salad dressed with vinaigrette for a light and refreshing meal.
4. Seafood Stir-Fry: If you're short on time, consider stir-frying a variety of seafood like shrimp, scallops, and mussels with some bell peppers, onions, and broccoli. This meal is quick, easy, and packed with nutrients. Simply heat up some oil in a wok or large skillet, add the ingredients, and cook until everything is tender.
5. Lentil and Smoked Salmon Salad: For a lighter seafood option, try combining cooked lentils with smoked salmon, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. This dish is not only healthy but also flavorful and satisfying.

I hope these suggestions inspire you to create a delicious seafood dinner!
