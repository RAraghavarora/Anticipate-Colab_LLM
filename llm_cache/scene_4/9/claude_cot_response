We know that the user wants to go to the gym, so they will prepare gym clothes after laundry. Since the living room is dirty, the user will clean the living room. We know that the user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge. So the user will prepare food using the rice and serve the food. After eating, the user will wash the dirty dishes before leaving for the gym.",
