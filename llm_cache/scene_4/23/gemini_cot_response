    'chain-of-thought': "Let us go through the requirements step by step. We see that the user has started a laundry which means they have dirty clothes. Since the user wants to go to the gym in the evening, we can infer that they will prepare their gym clothes after their laundry is done. Since the living room is dirty, we can infer that the user will clean the living room after their gym clothes are ready. We know that the user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge, so the user will prepare and serve themselves dinner. After dinner, the user can either put away the remaining food in the fridge or throw away the remaining food. Since we don't know the user's preference, we will anticipate that the user will put remaining food in the fridge.",
