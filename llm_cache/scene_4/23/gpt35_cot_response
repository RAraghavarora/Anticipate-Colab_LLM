The living room is dirty, so the user will first clean the living room. We know that the user wants to go to the gym, so they will need to prepare gym clothes. Checking if the gym clothes are clean. If the gym clothes are clean, the user can directly prepare the gym clothes. The user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge, so we can anticipate that the user will prepare food. Since there is rice in the fridge, the user can prepare a rice-based meal. We can also anticipate that the user will serve the food. Hence, the next tasks for the user are: clean the room (livingroom), prepare gym clothes, prepare food, serve the food.",
