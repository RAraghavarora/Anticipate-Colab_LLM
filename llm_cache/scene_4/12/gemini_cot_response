Since the living room is dirty, we can anticipate that the user will clean the living room. We know that the user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge. Since the user is hungry, they will prepare food. We know that the user has not taken their dinner yet, so they will prepare dinner. Hence we can anticipate that the user will prepare and eat pulao.",
