The third requirement is that the user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge. Since the user has just done the laundry, they will first prepare gym clothes. Since the user is hungry, we anticipate that they will next serve themselves the rice. Since the living room is very dirty, the user will clean it. Finally, the user will prepare food to eat after the gym.",
