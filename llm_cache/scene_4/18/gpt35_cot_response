The living room is dirty, so the user will first clean the living room. We know that the user wants to go to the gym, so they will prepare gym clothes. Checking if the user is hungry. Since the user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge, we can anticipate that the user will prepare and serve food with rice. After the user has eaten, they will serve the food. We have anticipated the next 4 tasks based on the requirements and previous observations.",
