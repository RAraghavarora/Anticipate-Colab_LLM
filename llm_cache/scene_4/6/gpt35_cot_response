Checking the requirements, we see that the living room is very dirty, so the user will clean the living room. We know that the user wants to go to the gym, so we can anticipate that the user will prepare gym clothes. Checking the requirements, we see that the user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge. Since the user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge, we can anticipate that the user will prepare and serve food. We can also anticipate that the user will serve rice as part of the meal.",
