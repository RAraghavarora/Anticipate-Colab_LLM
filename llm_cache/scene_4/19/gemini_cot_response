We know that in the evening, the user first prepares their casual clothes, then prepares and serves themselves dinner, and takes their medicines. We see that the user has already done the laundry, so they can prepare their casual clothes. Since the user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge, the user will prepare and eat rice. After eating, the user will take their medicines. Hence we can anticipate the user watching TV after doing all these tasks.",
