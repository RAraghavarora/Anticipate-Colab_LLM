    'chain-of-thought': "Let us go through the requirements step by step. The user has already done the task 'do the laundry', so we can think after that. The living room is very dirty, so the user will clean the living room. Since the user wants to go to the gym, they need to prepare gym clothes. Checking if the gym clothes are clean. Since the gym clothes are not mentioned in any of the previous observations, we cannot determine if they are clean or not. Hence, we cannot anticipate the task 'prepare gym clothes'. The user is hungry and there is rice in the fridge, so the user will prepare food. Checking if the rice is available. Since the rice is available, the user will prepare a meal with rice. The next task is to serve the food. Since the user wants to go to the gym, we can anticipate that they will serve a drink, most likely a protein shake, after the meal. Finally, the user will prepare their office bag, as it is not mentioned in any of the previous observations.",
