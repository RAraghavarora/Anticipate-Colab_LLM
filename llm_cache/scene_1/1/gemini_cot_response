The kitchen is very dirty, so the user will first clean the kitchen. Generally after coming back home from office in the evening, the user prepares a healthy dinner. Since the kitchen is dirty, the user will first clean the kitchen and then prepare and serve a healthy dinner. We can anticipate that the user will then take their medicines. After cleaning and preparing food, the user will store leftover food in the fridge.",
