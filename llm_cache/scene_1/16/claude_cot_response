    'chain-of-thought': "Since the user has just come home from the office and prepared casual clothes, we can anticipate their next tasks based on the evening routine described in 'observation 2'. The user typically prepares and serves a healthy dinner after changing into casual clothes. However, since the kitchen is very dirty (from the given requirement), the user will likely clean the kitchen before preparing food. After cleaning the kitchen, the user will prepare food, serve the food, and then take their medicines as per the usual routine. So the anticipated tasks are: clean the kitchen, prepare food, serve the food, and prepare medicines.",
