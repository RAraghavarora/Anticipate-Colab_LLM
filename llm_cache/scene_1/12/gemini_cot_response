In the evening, the user prepares their casual clothes (if they're clean). Then they prepare and serve a healthy dinner, and take their medicines. After that, they either store the leftover food back in the fridge, or throw it away. Since the user has prepared casual clothes, they will prepare a casual and fun dinner. Hence we can anticipate the user eating pizza.",
