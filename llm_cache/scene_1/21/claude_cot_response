    'chain-of-thought': "Since the user has just come home from the office and prepared casual clothes, we can infer that the next tasks will be related to evening routine. Based on the given observations, the typical evening routine involves preparing and serving dinner, taking medicines, and dealing with leftovers. However, since the requirement mentions that the kitchen is very dirty, we can anticipate that the user will need to clean the kitchen before preparing food.
