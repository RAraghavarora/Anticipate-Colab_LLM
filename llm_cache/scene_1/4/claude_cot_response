    'chain-of-thought': "Let us go through the requirements step by step. The user has already prepared casual clothes, so we can think after that. We know that in the evening the user prepares and serves dinner, takes medicines, and then either stores the leftover food in the fridge or throws it away. However, the kitchen is very dirty, so the user will first clean the kitchen before preparing food. After cleaning the kitchen, the user will prepare and serve their dinner. Since the user takes their medicine after food in the evening, we can anticipate that the user will prepare medicines. Finally, the user will either store the remaining food in the fridge or throw away the leftover food.",
