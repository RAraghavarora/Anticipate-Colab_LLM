We can anticipate that the user will first finish the requirement by washing the dirty dishes. Checking if all the dishes are dirty. Since all the dishes are dirty, the user will wash the dishes. We see that the user hasn't eaten lunch yet, so they will prepare and serve their lunch. Since soup is not available, the user will prepare a different dish.
