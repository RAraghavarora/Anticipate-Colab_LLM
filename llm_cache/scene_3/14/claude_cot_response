    'chain-of-thought': "Since the user has not eaten lunch yet and it is afternoon, we can anticipate that the user will prepare and serve their lunch. The user has just cleaned the living room, which is a common task before eating according to the observations. The requirement states that all dishes are dirty, so the user will likely wash the dishes before preparing food. The user typically prepares a healthy meal, and since soup is not available, we can anticipate the user making a different dish like a salad or sandwich. After eating, the user may want to put any remaining food in the fridge.",
