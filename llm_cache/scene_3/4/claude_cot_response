    'chain-of-thought': "Let's go through the requirements step by step. The user has cleaned the living room, which is not a usual afternoon task. We know the user hasn't eaten lunch yet, so they will likely prepare and serve lunch next. However, all the dishes are very dirty, so the user will need to wash the dishes before preparing lunch. After lunch, the user typically cleans the kitchen. Since the dishes were very dirty, the kitchen likely needs cleaning too. Finally, the user usually dusts electronic devices before bed, so that will likely be the last task. Soup is not available, but that doesn't impact the anticipated tasks.",
