Since the soup is not available, the user will prepare a different dish for lunch. After lunch, the user will prepare and serve a drink. Checking if the user has prepared casual clothes. The user has not prepared casual clothes, so they will not be going out. Hence, we can anticipate that the user will prepare gym clothes.
