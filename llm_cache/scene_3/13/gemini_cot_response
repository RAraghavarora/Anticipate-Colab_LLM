The user has not eaten lunch, so they will first prepare and serve their lunch. We know that the dishes are very dirty, so the user will wash the dishes. We see that soup is not available, so the user will not prepare soup. We can anticipate that the user will prepare a simple and quick lunch, such as a sandwich.",
