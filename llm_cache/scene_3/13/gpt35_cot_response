    'chain-of-thought': "Let us go through the requirements step by step. The user has already cleaned the living room, so we can think after that. We know that the user hasn't eaten lunch yet, so the next task will be to prepare and serve lunch. Checking if the dishes are dirty. Since all the dishes are very dirty, the user will first wash the dishes. We also know that soup is not available, so the user will prepare a different food item for lunch. After lunch, we can anticipate that the user will clean the kitchen as part of their routine. The user may also dust the electronic devices as part of their routine before going to sleep.",
