We can anticipate that the user will first check if the dishes are dirty. Since all the dishes are very dirty, the user will wash the dishes. Checking if soup is available. Since soup is not available, the user will prepare a different type of food. We can anticipate that the user will prepare lunch. After preparing lunch, the user will serve the food. We have anticipated the next 4 tasks based on the requirements and previous observations.",
