But since it is afternoon, and the user hasn't eaten lunch, we can anticipate them to prepare and serve their lunch. We see that the dishes are very dirty, so the user will most likely wash the dishes after they've eaten. After lunch, the user will likely prepare medicines. Since soup is not available, the user will most likely prepare salad for lunch.",
