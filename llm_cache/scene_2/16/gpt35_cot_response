    'chain-of-thought': "Let us go through the requirements step by step. The user has already cleaned the living room, so we can think after that. We know that before going to sleep, the user makes sure that the house is clean. Checking if the dishes are dirty. The dishes are dirty, so the user will wash the dishes. Also, we know that the kitchen is dirty, so the user will clean the kitchen. After cleaning the kitchen, we can anticipate that the user will dust the electronic devices. Since the user has already cleaned the living room, we can eliminate that. The next task is to clean the bedroom. Since we don't have any information about the bedroom's cleanliness, we can anticipate that the user will clean the bedroom. Hence, the next four tasks for the day are: wash the dishes, clean the room (kitchen), dust electronic devices, and clean the room (bedroom).",
