The user just cleaned the living room, so the valid next tasks are 'wash the dishes', 'clean the room (kitchen)', 'clean the room (bedroom)', and 'clean the room (bathroom)'. We can anticipate that the user will clean the dirtiest room next. Since we know that the kitchen and dishes are dirty, we can assume that they are dirtier than the bedroom and bathroom.",
