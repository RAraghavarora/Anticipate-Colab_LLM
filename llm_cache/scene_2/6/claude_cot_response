    'chain-of-thought': "Let us go through the requirements step by step. The user is preparing to sleep and has already cleaned the living room. Before sleeping, the user usually cleans the house. The requirements state that the dishes and kitchen are dirty. So the user will first clean the dishes, followed by cleaning the kitchen. After cleaning, the user dusts the electronic devices. There are no more tasks remaining before sleeping. Since we need to anticipate 4 tasks, I will add 'serve a drink (water)' as the user may drink water before sleeping.",
